# Crime Stoppers Data Analytics Project

This project was a collaborative effort by a group of students as part of a college course.

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data analytics and visualization project undertaken as part of our college course. The project focused on using Python to analyze and visualize a dataset, drawing meaningful insights from the data.

## Project Description

### Objective

The primary objective of this project was to apply data analytics and visualization techniques to gain insights from a real-world dataset. We aimed to demonstrate our understanding of data analysis processes, data visualization libraries in Python, and effective communication of findings.

### Dataset

We worked with a U.S. crime dataset that was publicly available on Kaggle but has since been removed. The data is available in this repo.

### Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing:** We cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We performed EDA to understand the dataset's characteristics, including data distribution, summary statistics, and identifying patterns or trends.

3. **Feature Engineering and Modeling:**: We performed feature engineering and evaluated the performance of various models.

4. **Data Visualization:** We created a variety of visualizations, including bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and more, to represent key insights from the data.

5. **Statistical Analysis:** We conducted statistical tests and analyses to validate our findings and hypotheses.

6. **Findings and Interpretation:** We documented our findings and provided interpretations, including insights, trends, and recommendations.
